# Focus-flow
A distraction-free task tracker and study timer using the Pomondoro method


I created a Pomodoro Timer Web App called Focus Flow to help users stay productive using time management techniques. The app:

Is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Runs entirely in the browser

Has a clean interface to start, pause, and reset a 25-minute timer

The project also demonstrates use of GitHub features such as:

GitHub Projects for planning

Branch management (main and dev)

GitHub Pages for deployment

GitHub Actions for workflow automation
